	/*arrays is an object it is used to store group of elements in to a single unit and its fixed in size 
	 * it is index based with the help of random accs interface e can easily acces the any index postion of element
	 * insertion order is preserved
	 * it is fixed in size and it s=is homogenous data type 
	 * array class extend object class and implments serilizble cloneble random accesss interfaces 
	 * it will be stored in heap area
	 * it is fast compare to collections becz primitive data type  will use wrapper classes to convert object but here it wont
	 * elements of array will be store in consective memory location
	 * we can store both object and primitive data type
	 * */
	
	//Why do we use arrays? Can we store different data type values in arrays?
	
	/* to store same group of elements in to a single unit and no we cannot store different data types
